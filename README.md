# Marketing Website Redesign

## Description 
This piece work is a demonstration of the capabilities of HTML and CSS. The aim of this work is to showcase the flexibility of HTML and CSS, showing how they work together to create a deliverable final product. In this project, I have used semantic HTML elements, and worked to make an effecient CSS file.
